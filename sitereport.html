        <h1>Index</h1>
        <p class="indexpara">In the index page, I wanted to quickly introduce myself to the webiste visitor and have brief look to who I am and what I do. I found that the background being animated suited the eye more than just a stable picture which is why I decided to go
            for a dynamic approach to it. The background was taken as a gif which suited the way I wanted the page to look like</p>
        <p class="preVal">Below, you can find the validation for the index page HTML, it's CSS, and its mobile version CSS as well:</p>

        <h1>Portfolio Page</h1>
        <p class="portPara">I wanted to have the portfolio grid as a 4 column grid inorder to properly display the work I made and please the eye because 2 was too less and 3 looked off so I settled with 4 and came out pretty happy with how it looked with 8 projects on there.
            The labels for them were a matter of postioning them acording to the images and the grid space for the whole project. I linked each label to their respective webpages which give extensive detail for the project and some even present the website
            I worked on.</p>
        <p class="preVal">Below, you can see the HTML and the CSS validation for both the desktop and the mobile versions of the portfolio page:</p>

        <h1>Contact Page</h1>
        <p>With the contact page, it was just a matter of making a form and postioning it to the center of the screen so it looks eye pleasing and attractive. There was not much more to the content but i t was mainly the CSS that worked on this page, I had
            the grid on the form be a 2 column grid in order to have the labels on one side with the input text boxes on the other which made it look better than the labels being on top.</p>

        <h1>Blog Page</h1>
        <p>To start off the blog page, I took inspiration from slack.com's blog page as the columns are the same along with the way the content is structured. I decided that the blog posts would each go into seperate columns and the content underneath it
            all.</p>
