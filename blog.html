            <p class="InitialDesc">Starting off when developing the website, it seemed like a mammoth task to do, I didn't now where to start or how to structure it. Lucily, I searched up examples online of good portfolio websites and I started seeing good layouts. First, I
                managed to make a gif background for this website, and I decided to tackle the tricky task of the navgation bar for all of the pages.</p>

            <p class="animeDesc">The site had many bugs when I made it at the start, mainly it was to do with page content not staying where they are supposed to stay when i played around with viewing dimensions. This became solved when i changed teh margin values from em
                to view width adn view height so that it stays proportional to the website dimensions being tinkered with.</p>

            <p class="BlogDesc">I've finally finished making the blog page fully complete; and it looks pretty cool. The hardest part for me in this blog page was trying to get the columns correct, since I kept putting in the wrong values for the grid templates, resulting
                in random columns for this page</p>
